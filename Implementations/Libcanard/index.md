# Libcanard

Libcanard is a minimal implementation of DroneCAN in C, suitable for deeply embedded systems and
resource constrained applications.
It is primarily targeted for low-end microcontrollers, starting from 8 KB ROM and 6 KB RAM.

The documentation and the usage examples are contained right in the
[source repository on Github](https://github.com/DroneCAN/libcanard).
Please proceed to read it there.

In particular please see the [example firmwares](https://github.com/dronecan/libcanard/tree/master/examples).

## Libcanard C++ interface

Libcanard now also includes a C++ interface providing a clean, light
weight implementation supporting the full DroneCAN feature set.
