# MAVLink bus transport layer

This chapter defines the MAVLink bus based transport layer of DroneCAN.

## DroneCAN on MAVLink

DroneCAN packets can be carried over MAVLink2 using either CAN_FRAME
or CAN_FRAME or CANFD_FRAME messages. Data in CAN_FRAME messages is
identical to the data in a bxCAN transport packet. Data in a
CANFD_FRAME message is identical to the data in a CANFD transport
packet.

## URI

When referring to a DroneCAN on MAVLink connection the prefix
"mavcan:" should be used in URIs followed by a standard MAVLink URI.
