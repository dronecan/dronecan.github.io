# UDP bus transport layer

This chapter defines the UDP bus based transport layer of DroneCAN.

## Ports and IP addresses

DroneCAN is carried over UDP using multicast packets. The default
multicast IP is 239.65.82.B where B is the DroneCAN bus number, where
0 is used for the first system bus.

The default multicast port is 57732.

## Packet format

The packet format is:
```
   - MAGIC 0x2934 16 bit
   - 16 bit CRC CRC-16-CCITT (over all bytes after CRC)
   - 16 bit flags
   - 32 bit message ID
   - data[]
```

All data is little endian.

## URIs

In tools where the transport is enumerated the URI is "mcast:B" where
B is the bus number. This means "mcast:0" is 239.65.82.0 on UDP port
57732.
